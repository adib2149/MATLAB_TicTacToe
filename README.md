# TicTacToe-in-Matlab
A Basic TicTacToe game created in Matlab for Lab Project

Please use this code

#Project

Develop a game of tic-tac-toe using MATLAB Graphical User Interface. The game should have single player and double player option.

#Planning

A GUI (graphical user interface) allows users to perform tasks interactively through controls such as buttons and sliders. 
GUI can be programmed in two ways: Interactively or Programmatically.
For our code, we are following the interactive approach. We will not be using GUIDE, rather we will write direct code to formulate figure, dialog box, buttons. This gives us more control over the code.
For Single player option, we need to write a code that contains a certain amount of intelligence, as players have to play against the computer, or to be specific, the code.
For Double player option, no intelligence is needed. Everything will be controlled by players.
We have added two more options; Credits and Exit.
